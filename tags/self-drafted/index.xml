Pattern humanoid pattern and abs tutorial by Nazfx + self drafting
Time Two months.
Gallery Maker&amp;rsquo;s Notes Body Patterning I started with a store bought plushie from the spirit TV show, as it had the leg and hip definition I was looking to emulate.
I tore it apart and copied the pattern, scanning it into the computer so that I could edit the lines using the path tool in gimp as per my standard workflow.</description>
