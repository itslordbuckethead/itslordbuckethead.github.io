<h2 id="makers-notes">Maker&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
<p>I improvised on the pattern a little bit by adding the stick up hair in the seam between the face and the scalp. This gave me a bit of trouble with the head back pieces because I didn&rsquo;t adapt them, I ended up making the scalp piece smaller and had trouble making the top of the head round.</p>
<p>I considered giving him more hair but it took me 2 tries to get the shapes I got on the fringe so I was fed up and decided not to. Ladder stitching on the back of the head is a bit rushed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with the eyes. The mouth is couch embroidered in but that didn&rsquo;t work for the eyebrows so I just plain hand embroidered them.</p>
<p>Every day I regretted making him real clothes more and more. I used the tights pattern from the fairy expansion, and adapted the sweater pattern to be more closely fit to the body. I wanted to do an invisible zip but couldn&rsquo;t find a tutorial on how to do it by hand, all the tutorials said to use a special sewing machine foot.</p>
<p>I like the bias tape for the straight lines, but didn&rsquo;t put enough pre-thought into how to embroider on the front design and don&rsquo;t like the hand done satin stitch. I like the belt but not the shoes.</p>
